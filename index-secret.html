            <h1>Avanade's Dedication to Open Source</h1>
            <p>As a joint venture between <a href="https://www.avanade.com/en/about-avanade/partnerships/accenture-avanade-microsoft-alliance">Accenture and Microsoft</a> Avanade is commited to delivering the power of the Microsofdt ecosystem to our clients.  There is no better way to do this than contributing to the rich open source Ecosystem that has evolved around the Microsoft Stack.</p>
            <p>While delivering enterprise-class solutions to our clients we do what we can to make things easier, faster and more predictable.  Often we create tools or scripts for automation.  Where our client contracts permit we intend to make those tools available to the community to use, adapt and enhance.</p>
            <p>Many of our solution offerings are under-pinned by frameworks that elevate the more generic Microsoft Platform Product to an industry solution.  We recognise that our client's don't want propiatory software so we intend to make them also available to the community and welcome the support to inspect and improve those frameworks.</p>
